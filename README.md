# About-me
Hail the sun! I am presently a Senior Research Associate in the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford, collaborating with [Dr. Francesco Giovanni Moretti](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=vLXx1skAAAAJ). My prior experience includes being a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge and spending a year at Twitter Cortex as an ML Researcher. I earned my PhD in Mathematics from UCL, focusing on the analysis of singularity formation of rotationally symmetric Ricci Flows. My current passion lies in Geometric Deep Learning, delving into both [theoretical](http://mrate.net/) foundations and applications in the scientific domain.

My ongoing research encompasses various aspects:
(i) Investigating information flow in message passing models, delving into phenomena like over-squashing, using metrics such as curvature and [commute time](https://targeted-visitors.com/shop/). We've received an ICLR honorable mention for our initial exploration in this direction. Recently, we've introduced a novel paradigm that precisely gauges the expressive power of message-passing models on graphs or point clouds based on their ability to induce interactions across different nodes.
(ii) Exploring how Graph [Neural Networks utilize underlying graph topology](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/why-is-my-website-traffic-declining-a-comprehensive-guide-to-boosting-your-online-visibility/ar-BB1hfEH9?fbclid=IwAR35AQN9J0A98QKIFaLYgZq0il215zcTeYbMDAKj-M1xyowAL2CGfd444Mw) and determining the extent to which the same input graph is needed for message exchange across layers. This leads to the intriguing field of graph-rewiring, where I'm working on applying these concepts to replace expensive Transformer-style architectures.
(iii) Leveraging the geometry of data in designing generative modeling approaches, particularly in the context of Flow Matching and Diffusion Models.
(iv) A [recent work](https://community.mozilla.org/en/events/expert-strategies-for-amplifying-online-presence-and-attracting-more-traffic-in-2024/) explores this Analyzing the impact of enforcing symmetries and/or exact constraints on the training dynamics.
